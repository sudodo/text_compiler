## Q

Please write a python script to compile text files that include "@import(/path/to/other_file.txt)" directive into a single text file.

Specifically, the requirements are:

- A single input file is specified by an option (e.g. --input-file-path (-i))
- The script reads the input file and replaces the "@import" directive with the content of the file specified by the directive.
- It works with recursive "@import" directive. For example, if the input file includes "@import(/path/to/other_file.txt)" and the other_file.txt includes "@import(/path/to/another_file.txt)", the script should replace the "@import" directive with the content of the another_file.txt as well.
- Any file extension is allowed. The script just should read the content of the file and replace the "@import" directive with the content of the file.


## Q

I think it should handle some edge cases such as:

- Circular import
- The file specified by the "@import" directive does not exist
- The file specified by the "@import" directive is not readable (e.g. permission denied)

First, please list up these edge cases.

## Q
Certainly! Here are my suggestions on how to handle each of the listed edge cases in your script:

1. **Circular Imports**:
   - Implement a mechanism to track imported files (e.g., using a set). Before importing a file, check if it's already been imported. If it has, you can skip the import to prevent infinite recursion, possibly logging a warning.

Agree.

2. **Non-existent File Imports**:
   - When an "@import" directive points to a non-existent file, catch the `FileNotFoundError` and handle it by either logging a warning or error and skipping the import, or by halting the execution with a clear error message, depending on how critical this case is for your application.

Show the error message clearly and halt the execution.

3. **File Access Issues (Permission Denied)**:
   - Catch exceptions related to file access (like `PermissionError`). Handle these by logging an appropriate error message and either skipping the problematic file or stopping the script execution.

Show the error message clearly and halt the execution.

4. **Empty or Malformed "@import" Directives**:
   - Validate the format of the "@import" directive. If it doesn't meet the expected pattern (e.g., empty path, malformed syntax), log a warning or error and skip the directive.

Show the error message clearly and halt the execution.

5. **Large File Imports**:
   - Implement file size checks before importing. If a file exceeds a certain threshold, either skip the import with a warning or handle it in a way that mitigates performance issues (e.g., streaming the file content instead of reading it all at once).

Agree. A user can specify the maximum file size by an option (e.g. --max-file-size (-m)). The default value is 100MB.

6. **Nested Imports Beyond a Reasonable Depth**:
   - Keep track of the depth of nesting and set a reasonable limit. If this limit is exceeded, log a warning or error and stop further imports to prevent stack overflow.

Agree. A user can specify the maximum depth of nesting by an option (e.g. --max-nesting-depth (-d)). The default value is 10.

7. **Import Loops Among Multiple Files**:
   - This is similar to handling circular imports. Maintain a record of all imported files and their paths to detect loops.

Agree.

8. **Special File Types or Encodings**:
   - If you expect certain file types or encodings, validate the file before importing. If a file does not meet the criteria, log a warning or error and skip the import.

Show the error message clearly and halt the execution if the file does not meet the criteria.

9. **Files with the Same Name in Different Directories**:
   - Use absolute paths for imports or clearly define the rules for resolving file paths. If there's ambiguity, log a message indicating which file is being imported.

User should be able to use relative paths for imports as well. If a relative path is specified, the script should resolve the path based on the location of the file that includes the "@import" directive.

## Q

Does your code allows a user to import the same file in a not circular way?

For example, I think the below case is permitted because it is not circular.

file A imports file B and file C. file B imports file C.
